## Hi there, welcome to my profile 👋
I call myself a reflective practitioner: I love thinking and writing about good coding practices. also love: dev tool building, network programming, and IaC

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an agentic tool which will help me better reflect on my software development practice and (maybe) make the agent better understand me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kubernetes (using MiniKube), Pub/Sub architecture, and Cryptography.
